        <h1>Must try Restaurants in Rizal</h1>

        <h3>Coffee Rush, Binangonan</h3>
        <p>Coffee Rush Eastridge, which is located on top of a hill in Binangonan, Rizal, provides fresh air as well as a stunning view of the Metro Manila cityscape and Laguna Bay. The al fresco dining area at Coffee Rush Eastridge has a rustic feel to it. The area features largely wooden furniture, capiz shell-studded sliding windows, a campfire pit, and even a wooden wagon, all of which are Instagram-worthy.</p>

        <h3>Mangantila Cafe and Restaurant </h3>
        <p>This traditional open-air restaurant, located just off the main highway on the beaches of Laguna Lake, is a quiet place to eat and enjoy the breeze away from the city. If you're lucky enough to obtain a clear view without other people in the backdrop, there's a lovely tree tunnel leading in.</p>

        <h3>Bulawan Floating Restaurant </h3>
        <p>Bulawan Restaurant is encircled by a fish pond, giving it the appearance of floating on water. Restaurant patrons can enjoy a refreshing wind from the trees that flank the shore at any time of day. Dining is also done outside, making it safer for everyone in the event of a pandemic. From the broad menu, you can get fresh fish and veggies. Alimango, tilapia, salmon, and other fish are available. Their Fiesta Inihaw feast includes tilapia, bangus, hito, pusit, porkchop, along, and okra, among other things. While you're there, try their wonderful Adobo sa Gata Hito and Crispy Noodles. A sulit supper will cost between P800 to P1,000 for a family of four.</p>

        <h3>Rambulls - Bakahan sa Tanay </h3>
        <p>The establishment resembles a saloon straight out of a Western Cowboy film. From the outside, you'd know you're in for a treat with its swinging doors and continuous display of cow skulls. Plus, with so many cars parked outside, it's difficult not to be lured to it. That in and of itself is a sign of good food.</p>
